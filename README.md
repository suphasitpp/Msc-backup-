# MoveIt + med7 + da Vinci Tool Integration Logbook

**Last updated: 2025-07-17**

## Project Overview
This workspace contains the ROS 2 and MoveIt configuration for a KUKA med7 robot arm with an attached da Vinci tool, including a virtual tip for precise motion planning.

---

## Achievements Log

### ✅ Initial Setup
- Created ROS 2 workspace and imported med7 and da Vinci tool Xacro/URDF files.
- Set up MoveIt configuration package (`moveit_config_attached`).

### ✅ Virtual Tip Integration
- Added a `PSM_tool_virtual_tip` link at the end of the tool for use as the planning tip.
- Connected the virtual tip to the tool main link using a dummy actuated joint (`virtual_tip_dummy`) with a tiny range, to ensure MoveIt recognizes it as the tip link.

### ✅ MoveIt Planning Groups
- Defined the "arm" group as a chain from `world` to `PSM_tool_virtual_tip`.
- Defined the "tooltip" group for the tool/jaw joints.
- Set the end effector to the tooltip group, attached to `PSM_tool_main_link`.

### ✅ Configuration & Debugging
- Fixed URDF/SRDF mismatches and removed references to obsolete joints.
- Ensured all config files (SRDF, kinematics.yaml, joint_limits.yaml) are up to date.
- Added install rules for URDF/Xacro so MoveIt can find the robot model at runtime.
- Cleaned and rebuilt the workspace multiple times to resolve build and runtime issues.

### ✅ Version Control & Backup
- Initialized git and added a `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts.
- Pushed the entire workspace to [GitHub](https://github.com/suphasitpp/Msc-backup-.git) for backup and collaboration.

### ✅ Final Test
- Confirmed that MoveIt and RViz launch successfully.
- The interactive marker is at the virtual tip.
- Planning and execution work as expected.

## Next Steps / Notes
- For new hardware or config changes, update the URDF/Xacro and SRDF, then rebuild and commit.
- Always source the workspace before launching MoveIt.
- Use this logbook to track future changes and milestones!
